# Overview
This document outlines the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the "Overthrone" game. It serves to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the development of the game, including system behavior, performance expectations, user interactions, and technical constraints. This SRS will guide the development team in creating a robust, engaging, and scalable multiplayer board game experience.

# Software Requirements
This section provides a detailed description of the software requirements for the "Overthrone" game. It is divided into two main parts: functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements define the expected behaviors and interactions within the game, such as player actions, game logic, and system responses. Non-functional requirements focus on performance, reliability, usability, and other system attributes that ensure the game operates efficiently and provides a high-quality user experience. Each requirement is linked to specific game features and processes to ensure traceability and clear implementation goals.

# Change management plan
## How will you train people to use it?
To train users on how to use the game, we will present a video for those interested. This video will feature an in-game tutorial that walks users through the basic mechanics (e.g., creating a lobby, rolling dice, choosing paths). This allows users to learn the game step-by-step without feeling overwhelmed. We will also make the training process more engaging, consider gamifying the onboarding experience, where players can complete challenges and earn rewards for learning the game's features. 
##	How will you ensure it integrates within their ecosystem / software?
To ensure that it integrates with the current ecosystem, we will ensure that the game can be played across the most common platforms used by the customer, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. This will ensure that employees can play regardless of the device they use. We will also integrate with the companyâ€™s authentication systems (e.g., Active Directory or SSO services) to simplify user access and avoid the need for additional login credentials, and repeated name creation ingame.
##	How will you ensure that it any discovered issues are resolved?
To ensure that any discovered issues are resolved, we will incorporate a built-in feedback tool that allows players to report bugs, suggest improvements, or submit feature requests. This will help us gather insights into user experiences and pinpoint pain points. With this we will establish a dedicated support team or helpdesk to resolve technical issues quickly. This team should be available to provide assistance via chat, email, or ticketing systems. They should be well-versed in common issues that might arise in corporate environments. Following these evenets, we will also have Regularly releases of software updates that address discovered issues and introduce new features. Provide patch notes so users can see what changes have been made, helping them stay informed.
# Tracability Links
This section outlines the traceability links between the various game artifacts (use cases, class diagrams, activity diagrams, etc.) and their corresponding functional and non-functional requirements. Traceability ensures that each requirement is properly addressed throughout the design and development process. By mapping requirements to specific game components and actions, we can ensure that the "Overthrone" game meets its intended functionality, performance, and user experience expectations. This section serves as a reference to track the implementation of requirements and verify that all aspects of the system are accounted for and properly executed.
