Logic:

Player rolls dice, and moves amount that amout of spaces. They will take the action of the space they landed on.

"S" spaces = If a player lands on an S, they are safe and cannot be affected by any action

"N" spaces = If a player lands on an N, set all players's points to 0

"Z" spaces = If a player lands on an Z, All players move backwars that many spaces (only the player who landed on he Z take subsequent actions)

"Choose Path = If a player lands touches this tile on their turn they must stop, reroll, and chose a path to go down

"GP" spaces = If a player lands on an GP, player must give X points to one other player (ie. GP = Give 1 of your points to 1 other player, GP2 = Give 2 of your points to one other player of your choice)

"TP" spaces = If a player lands on an TP, player must take X points from one other play(ie. TP = Take 1 point from 1 other player, TP2 = Take 2 points from one other player of your choice)

"+X" spaces = If a player lands on an a postive number, add this number to your point total

"-X" spaces = If a player lands on a negative number, sebtract this number from your point total

After last player rolls: Start a random minigame, winners of minigame get points based on placement

If a player reaches an endpoint, ther spawn at a random start point
